    "<h2 id=\"Context\">Context<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Context\">¶</a></h2><p>A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.</p>\n",
    "<p>The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers' booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.</p>\n",
    "<p>The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.</li>\n",
    "<li>Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.</li>\n",
    "<li>Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.</li>\n",
    "<li>Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<h2 id=\"Objective\">Objective<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Objective\">¶</a></h2><p>The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.</p>\n",
